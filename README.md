# EDV-Laon

### Summary

This project is connected to the Data Visualization course, 
but depending on your background knowledge of data visualization, 
dimple.js, and d3.js you may not need to take the whole course to complete this project.

After completing Lesson 2 and Problem Set 2 of the course, 
you will be able to complete this project since you will have learned about dimple.js.

If you want to become more technical and expand your skill set, 
you can continue to Lesson 3 and Lesson 4, in which you will learn more 
about narrative structures and how to create graphics using d3.js. 
The d3.js library has a steeper learning curve, and we encourage you to take on the challenge if you desire.


### Design

The project decide to use XXX chart because it is suite with differentiate data 
and to support more than to variable we use xxx technique to enchant visualize.
