### Summary

This project is connected to the Data Visualization course, 
but depending on your background knowledge of data visualization, 
dimple.js, and d3.js you may not need to take the whole course to complete this project.

After completing Lesson 2 and Problem Set 2 of the course, 
you will be able to complete this project since you will have learned about dimple.js.

If you want to become more technical and expand your skill set, 
you can continue to Lesson 3 and Lesson 4, in which you will learn more 
about narrative structures and how to create graphics using d3.js. 
The d3.js library has a steeper learning curve, and we encourage you to take on the challenge if you desire.


### Design

The project decide to use :

#### Bar chart and Line Chart
because it is suite with differentiate data and show the trend of data.

#### Geomap

#### Boxplot
because it is suite with differentiate data between category and can also show the distribution of it.
 

### Step

#### Draft a story
After I got the data I try to mark down what is the interesting story behide this 
and I found out that the most interesting variables are 
amount of loan and yield; I try to draft the visualization by using tableau public and found the co-related interesting variables such as
Loan Original Date, Brrower Rating , Credit Grade, Prosper Rating and Borrower State.

#### Processing Data

The data is too large so I need to process the data to optimize the size of resource that 
be used to create the visualization by create python script using numpy and pandas; 

1st View Loan Original Date vs Sum(Loan Amount) vs ListingCategory - Show trend
2nd State vs vs Sum(LoanAmount) On date - Show Loan density
3nd View CreditGrade vs Borrower Rate - Show relation between Grade and Borrower Rate
4nd View ProsperRating vs Borrower Rate - Show relation between Grade and Borrower Rate
